name: code-review
description: Review code changes for security, performance, and correctness. Trigger with a PR URL or diff, "review this before I merge", "is this code safe?", or when checking a change for N+1 queries, injection risks, missing edge cases, or error handling gaps.
argument-hint: "<PR URL, diff, or file path>"

> **Lens Lab project note** (added for this repo; everything below the note is Anthropic's original skill from [anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) `engineering/skills`, commit `da38ec1`, unchanged).
>
> Lens Lab is a static Vite + TypeScript + three.js app deployed to GitHub Pages: no server, database or auth, so
> the SQL / N+1 / CSRF items rarely apply. Review instead for: correctness of the optics maths in `src/optics/` (a formula
> change needs a hand-calculated case in `tests/` and in the verification tables of `PLAN.md`); three.js hygiene (dispose
> geometries, materials, textures and render targets on lens swaps; no allocations in per-frame code); `innerHTML` built
> from data strings (escape them); lazy-chunk boundaries (`import()` of views and `data/` JSON); data accuracy (specs come
> from the listed sources, unverified values stay `null`). Checks: `npm test`, `npm run build` (`tsc --noEmit && vite build`).
> Claude Code also has a built-in `/code-review`; this project skill uses the same name.

Review code changes with a structured lens on security, performance, correctness, and maintainability.

## Usage

```
/code-review <PR URL or file path>
```

Review the provided code changes: @$1

If no specific file or URL is provided, ask what to review.

## How It Works

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      CODE REVIEW                                   │

│  ✓ Performance review (N+1, memory leaks, complexity)           │
│  ✓ Correctness (edge cases, error handling, race conditions)    │
│  ✓ Style (naming, structure, readability)                        │

## Review Dimensions

### Security
- SQL injection, XSS, CSRF
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Secrets or credentials in code
- Insecure deserialization
- Path traversal
- SSRF

### Performance
- N+1 queries
- Unnecessary memory allocations
- Algorithmic complexity (O(n²) in hot paths)
- Missing database indexes
- Unbounded queries or loops
- Resource leaks

### Correctness
- Edge cases (empty input, null, overflow)
- Race conditions and concurrency issues
- Error handling and propagation
- Off-by-one errors
- Type safety

### Maintainability
- Naming clarity
- Single responsibility
- Duplication
- Test coverage
- Documentation for non-obvious logic

## Output

### What Looks Good
- [Positive observations]

### Verdict
[Approve / Request Changes / Needs Discussion]
```

## If Connectors Available

If **~~source control** is connected:
- Pull the PR diff automatically from the URL
- Check CI status and test results

If **~~project tracker** is connected:
- Link findings to related tickets
- Verify the PR addresses the stated requirements

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Check changes against team coding standards and style guides

## Tips

1. **Provide context** — "This is a hot path" or "This handles PII" helps me focus.
2. **Specify concerns** — "Focus on security" narrows the review.
3. **Include tests** — I'll check test coverage and quality too.
